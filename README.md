## Hi! I'm Franco ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Functional Analyst** and **Software Developer** from Argentina, specializing in web application development. I'm passionate about software engineering and enjoy building efficient, scalable technological solutions.

I work with **React** on the frontend and **Django REST Framework** on the backend, developing robust, well-structured APIs. I'm proactive, resourceful, and a strong team player. I'm always learning and exploring new tools and technologies to enhance both my technical and interpersonal skills.

Currently, alongside my job, I'm pursuing a **Bachelor's Degree in Technologies for Organizational Management**, which enables me to blend technical expertise with management insights in my projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and if youâ€™re interested in collaborating or just want to chat about development, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
